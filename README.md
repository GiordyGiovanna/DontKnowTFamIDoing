# Me trying to do shit in python

### Resources
As far as i'm concerned you shound see this folder but it exists and contains txt resources and stuff

### utils.py
This file contains all Utils functions (Shitty way to contain theme, I know)

### UsingThisOneToUnderstanFunctions.py (deprecated UwU) 
It's just a bad idea, i'm going to add it to the gitignore

### 00 - Machine Learning Prog
It's stanford's machine learning part of the 2019 ai course. I coded it, so it's poop.
